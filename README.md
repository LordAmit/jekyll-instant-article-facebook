# Facebook Instant Article âš¡ RSS Feed - Jekyll

Facebook instant article rss feed generator for Jekyll static site generator. It is based on liquid tags and insanely simple!

## Setup / Installation / Configuration
Installation requires downloading an XML file based on which `RSS Feed` will be generated. It is dependent on some `Jekyll-plugins` and some configurations in `_config.yml` file.

### 1. Downloading XML file

Please go to the [Releases](https://github.com/lordamit/jekyll-instant-article-facebook/releases) section. Download the latest release.

### 2. Installing jekyll-plugins
You need the following plugins:
- [jekyll-figure](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/jekyll-figure)

### 3. Configuring \_config.yml file
Based on the settings, your rss feed generator will be able to use default image as feature image, default titles and some other things.
```yaml
title: Your website title here
description: "Your Website description here"
url: http://yoursite.com
default_bg: sitelogo.png
baseurl: ""
owner:
  name:           Your name here
  avatar:         images/Your_image.jpg
```
That should be enough. I should emphasize on the fact that these are also dependent on your jekyll-configuration, so you might have to tweak around a bit.

## Customizing Instant Article based on Post
The Instant feed RSS generator is your post aware, and based on the YAML front matter, it will insert / replace values - making your article suitable for Facebook instant article publication.

```yaml
#image is used to specify an image for your article. If not used, it will use the default sitelogo specified in _config.yml
image: "ImageURL here"
# based on instantfeedback - it will show like buttons for feedback in your post
instantfeedback: true|false
# if you have used any image or contents from others, please give it credit.
credit: "Credit text here"
```

That should do it! Please head over to the [Sites using](https://github.com/lordamit/jekyll-instant-article-facebook/wiki/Sites-using-jekyll-instant-article-facebook) section to include your site's address.

Thank you!
